Responsive Design
Built with mobile-first principles, the site adapts seamlessly across screen sizes. Whether viewed on a phone, tablet, or large monitor, the layout remains crisp and intuitive.

Purpose
This project was created as a front-end design challenge to replicate the feel of a high-end fashion brand’s website. It serves as a showcase of UI/UX skills, responsive design techniques, and attention to visual detail. (Bonus Feature: When you open the site and navigate to the "New" section in the main menu, then click on the "Fall Winter" link, you’ll be taken to a separate section of the site that highlights seasonal collections and exclusive content.)
